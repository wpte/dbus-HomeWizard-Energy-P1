# dbus-homewizard-energy-p1
Integrate HomeWizard Energy P1 meter into [Victron Energies Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus)

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo, it should be easy to install, uninstall, and restart a service that connects the HomeWizard Energy P1 to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.
The idea is based on @RalfZim's project linked below.

## Inspiration
This project is my first on GitHub and with the Victron Venus OS, so I took some ideas and approaches from the following projects - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:
- https://github.com/RalfZim/venus.dbus-fronius-smartmeter
- https://github.com/victronenergy/dbus-smappee
- https://github.com/Louisvdw/dbus-serialbattery
- https://community.victronenergy.com/idea/114716/power-meter-lib-for-modbus-rtu-based-meters-from-a.html - [Old Thread](https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/85564/eastron-sdm630-modbus-energy-meter-community-editi.html)
- https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter

## How it works
### My setup
- HomeWizard Energy P1 with the latest firmware 
  - 1 or 3-Phase installation (normal for the Netherlands)
  - Connected to Wifi network "A"
  - IP 192.168.2.13/24  
- Victron Energy Cerbo GX with Venus OS - Firmware v3.11
  - No other devices from Victron connected (still waiting for shipment of Multiplus-2)
  - Connected to Wifi network "A"
  - IP 192.168.2.20/24

### Details / Process
As mentioned above, the script is inspired by @RalfZim's Fronius smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- Connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.grid.http_40` or `com.victronenergy.pvinverter.http_40`
- After successful DBus connection, HomeWizard P1 is accessed via REST-API - simply the /status is called and a JSON is returned with all details
  A sample JSON file from HomeWizard Energy P1 can be found [here](docs/homewizard-energy-p1.json)
- Serial is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that, a "loop" is started which pulls HomeWizard P1 data every 750ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

That's it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grab a copy of the main branch and copy it to `/data/dbus-HomeWizard-Energy-P1`.
After that, call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:
```
wget https://github.com/wpte/dbus-HomeWizard-Energy-P1/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-HomeWizard-Energy-P1-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-HomeWizard-Energy-P1-main /data/dbus-HomeWizard-Energy-P1
chmod a+x /data/dbus-HomeWizard-Energy-P1/install.sh
/data/dbus-HomeWizard-Energy-P1/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Check the configuration after that - because the service is already installed and running, and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log file.

### Change config.ini
Within the project, there is a file `/data/dbus-HomeWizard-Energy-P1/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the host, username, and password in the section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section  | Config value | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| DEFAULT  | CustomName  | Name of your device - useful if you want to run multiple versions of the script |
| DEFAULT  | DeviceInstance  | DeviceInstanceNumber e.g. 40 |
| DEFAULT  | Role | Fixed value:  'GRID' |
| DEFAULT  | Position | Fixed value: 0 = AC|
| DEFAULT  | LogLevel  | Define the level of logging - lookup: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels |
| DEFAULT  | Phases  | 1 for 1 phase system / 3 for 3 phase system |
| ONPREMISE  | Host | IP or hostname of on-premise HomeWizard Energy P1 web interface |
| ONPREMISE  | L1Position | Which input on the HomeWizard in 3-phase grid is supplying a single Multi |

<!-- ### Remapping L1
In a 3-phase grid with a single Multi, Venus OS expects L1 to be supplying the only Multi. This is not always the case. If for example your Multi is supplied by L3 (Input `C` on the HomeWizard) your GX device will show AC Loads as consuming from both L1 and L3. Setting `L1Position` to the appropriate HomeWizard input allows for remapping the phases and showing correct data on the GX device.

If your single Multi is connected to the Input `A` on the HomeWizard you don't need to change this setting. Setting `L1Position` to `2` would swap the `B` CT & Voltage sensors data on the HomeWizard with the `A` CT & Voltage sensors data on the HomeWizard. Respectively, setting `L1Position` to `3` would swap `A` and `C` inputs. -->
